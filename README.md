# Corrupted Selma Block Mod

## Features

- Singular purple skulk-purpur block ("Corrupted Selma Block"): slowly spreads corruption.
- Corruption spreads to blocks and **corrupts mobs** (glowing, strong, particle effects).
- Corrupted mobs spread the block as they walk.
- Designed for Fabric Minecraft 1.21.

## Usage

1. Build and install with Fabric Loader and API for 1.21.
2. Give yourself the block with `/give @p selmablockmod:corrupted_selma_block`.
3. Place it. Watch the world and mobs corrupt, skulk/purpur style!

## Customization

- Replace `src/main/resources/assets/selmablockmod/textures/block/corrupted_selma_block.png` with your own purple skulk-purpur texture if desired.

**Enjoy the corruption, Selma and Wendy!**
